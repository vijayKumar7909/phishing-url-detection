# Phishing URL Detection using Deep Learning

This project detects phishing websites using a deep learning model trained on URL-based datasets. The model classifies URLs as either **phishing** or **legitimate**, helping protect users from fraudulent websites.

## 🚀 Features

- Character-level URL encoding
- Deep learning (LSTM) architecture for sequence-based URL detection
- Trained on datasets including malicious and legitimate URLs
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Kaggle datasets

## 📊 Dataset

- Dataset used: [Malicious URLs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset)
- Includes both phishing and benign URLs for training.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-url-detection.git
   cd phishing-url-detection

   
2.Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the notebook:
Open phishing-url-detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

📌 Results
The LSTM model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing phishing URLs, demonstrating deep learning's effectiveness in sequence-based detection tasks.
